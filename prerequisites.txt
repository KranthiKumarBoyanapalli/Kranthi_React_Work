The Angular CLI makes it easy to create an application that already works, right out of the box. It already follows our best practices!

ng generate
Generate components, routes, services and pipes with a simple command. The CLI will also create simple test shells for all of these.

ng serve
Easily test your app locally while developing.

Test, Lint, Format
Make your code really shine. Run your unittests or your end-to-end tests with the breeze of a command. Execute the official Angular linter and run clang format.


npm install -g create-react-app

//' -g means global. from any location in system we can install reactjs
once installed react, need to link project folder as below

>create-react-app <folder>

Example:
---------
E:\React>create-react-app SampleProject
Could not create a project called "SampleProject" because of npm naming restrictions:
  *  name can no longer contain capital letters
OutPut:
-------
Success! Created sampleproject at E:\React\sampleproject
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd sampleproject
  npm start

sampleproject folder now contain WHAT?
-------------------------------------
node_modules, public, src folders and readme.md file

Furthersteps"sampleproject" created
>cd sampleproject
>npm start
Output: it opens the project
You can now view sampleproject in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000/
  On Your Network:  http://192.168.1.11:3000/

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use npm run build.

Above lins shows as below..
-----------------------------
To get started, edit src/App.js and save to reload.
